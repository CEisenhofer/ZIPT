Features:
	Regular expressions
	Str <-> Int

Calculus optimizations:
	Check set of possible first characters when comparing two non-variable tokens
	If length of variable known => replace by symbolic characters (up to threshold)
	If variables occur always in pairs xy => z'
	Add subsumption again

Implementation:
	Lazy rewrite stuff (variable numbering?)
	Track which constraint contains which non-terminals; only simplify if change happened#
	Move to Z3
	Use Z3's integer solver
